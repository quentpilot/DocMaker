# DocMaker
This program would to generate a personal, shared, advanced,... documentation included to your own projects (Java, C++, PHP,...).
DocMaker should be developped in different languages such as Java (first), C++, PHP... and why not with other languages.
- First, because I want to test advanced OOP pattern designs with differents languages, it's fun.
- Then, to be edited by anybody who has enougth knowledge about related language. So DocMaker can be customized as you want.

### Main Focuses
- DocMaker would be able to build static/dynamic website documentation customizable as many as possible from intern database formated on differents languages like Json, SQL,...
To do so, an editor will be integrated to DocMaker from command-line, Admin CMS part and/or from his own GUI software management.
- DocMaker would to be able to generate a UNIX Man documentation following your current project.
- DocMaker would to build a Javadoc, PHPdoc and others following your project source code.
